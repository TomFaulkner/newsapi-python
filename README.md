## General

This is a Python client library for News API V2. The functions for the library should mirror the
endpoints from the [documentation](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints).

## Fork
Methods have been updated to match the API. (no get_ at the beginning)
Timeout and other overrides were added.
Other improvements have been made, that may include breaking changes for older Python
versions. (3.5+ required)

Hopefully the updated doc strings, type hinting, and assertions will ease use of this library.

I have not published it to PyPI, as the changes were started for my own use, and the original
author is maintaining his package at this time.


## Installation
Installation for the package can be done via pip.

git clone the repository, or download it, then run:

```commandline
    pip install ./newsapi-python
```

## Usage

After installation, import client into your project:

```python
from newsapi import NewsApi
```

Initialize the client with your API key:

```python
api = NewsApi(api_key='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX')
```

### Endpoints

#### Top Headlines

```python
api.top_headlines(sources=['bbc-news','fox-news'])
```
#### Everything

api.everything(q=['bitcoin','ethereum'])
```
#### Sources

```
